### Model Description

  CatBoost is a state-of-the-art open-source gradient
boosting on decision trees library. Developed by Yandex
researchers and engineers, it is the successor of the
MatrixNet algorithm that is widely used within the
company for ranking tasks, forecasting and making
recommendations. It is universal and can be applied across
a wide range of areas and to a variety of problems.
